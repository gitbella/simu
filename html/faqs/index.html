									According to the Interim Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Private Equity Investment Fund, a qualified investor of Private Equity Funds shall refer to an entity or individual that has the appropriate capability of risk identification and risk tolerance, invests at least Rmb1mn&nbsp; in a single Private equity Fund, and meets any of the following standards: &nbsp;

								  <p class="sys_cjwt_p" id="w1000">
									1. To ensure the safety of money, investors should examine the qualification of a fund management institution as well as the fund manager who will ultimately manage the investment. Generally, private equity fund management companies will undergo the fund recordation formalities with the securities regulatory authority. Additionally, a qualified fund custodian will be appointed for safekeeping of the fund assets, such as a commercial bank or any other financial institution. Investors should never invest with unqualified private fund management companies in a bid to protect their interests.
&nbsp;<br/>
2. The research capability and risk controls rules of a private equity fund management company are also a key point to check. The track record of a private fund manager throughout the entire market cycles plays an important role when considering the consistency of fund performance.<br/>
3. Investors are recommended to understand the private equity fund managers&rsquo; investment philosophy, strategies and styles. Generally, a seasoned fund manager, with an investment philosophy founded on extensive investment experience, is more likely to generate consistent returns in the long run. Meanwhile, investors are suggested to make investment decisions based on their risk appetite and investment styles.<br/>
4. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the financial market will facilitate investment decisions in accordance with investment styles.</p>
